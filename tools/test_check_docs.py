"""The corpus check_docs.py must agree with, so a divergence is not an occasion.

The hub and the device each keep a copy of this checker, and today each copy's
arbitrary choice covered a hole in the other's: one keyed on owned prefixes and
had precision inline, one keyed on case and had recall inside fences. Neither was
chosen for the reason it mattered, and both holes were found by running the
other's cases rather than by reading the other's diff.

That works while both copies are exercised against the same cases and decays into
two half-checkers the first week nobody cross-runs them - and nothing forces a
cross-run. This is the corpus that does: every case either session found, with
what must be reported and what must stay silent. Run it against either copy.
